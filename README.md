# CougarSearch
The collection of files together found in the reposistory, create the website Cougar Search. Cougar Search is for potentional listers and adopters to post and browse through dogs that need to be adopted.

Anyone can use Cougar Search to browse dog profiles, but only registered users can list their dogs and contact other users through the listed email. All dog profiles will have to be approved by the administrator before the dog profile is uploaded so please expect a 24 hour period before new dogs are posted.

Cougar Search uses moderators and administrators to keep dog profiles up to date and ensure appropriate use of the site.
